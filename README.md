This project is my first attempt of creating a web based application using AI.

I have many years of experiene with command line applicaions in C++, but very limited experience with fullstack programming.
My goal was to create a web application by using AI as much as possible.

This work was done alongside my students in the "Michlala" Jerusalem College.
I teach a course called "Contemporary Internet Technologies". The course is a project-based course in which each students work in small teams (2-3) on a programming project.
